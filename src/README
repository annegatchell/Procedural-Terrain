Project Review


compile with make
run with ./main

The only thing that comes up is a white window, because I am currently just
working on getting the density function to run in the fragment shader and
write density values into a 3D texture. This render pass is not the final
pass.

The next render pass must go through the Marching Cubes algorithm, looking
in the lookup table using the values of the density at the corners. 

So, I need to get my 3d texture to work, and then I need to do the second 
render pass.

Given how hard it has been to get things to go right with the density function,
I am a little concerned about the rest of the project. I am having issues with
Geometry Shaders.

I will be very happy if I can get to the point where i can render a block
(and all voxels within it) with an interesting terrain. I guess Dane and 
his friend were trying this approach and they couldn't get it working. I
really want to get it working, even if in an inefficient state. I don't want
to use the CPU to generate the terrain.
